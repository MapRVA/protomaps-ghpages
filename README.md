# Github Actions built & Github Pages hosted Protomaps Extract & Styles

This repo contains scripts and Github Actions configuration to create a Protomaps exctract for the
area defined in `region.geojson` and a style to go along with it.

This allows you to very easily host your own basemap for a small to medium sized area with Github
Pages.

The default region is the state of Virginia in the United State of America.

To create your own Github Pages hosted basemap:

- Fork this repository
- Replace `region.geojson` with the region of your choice
- Enable Github Actions on your fork
- Push your updated region
